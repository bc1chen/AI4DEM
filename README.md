# AI4PDE -> AI4DEM

#### Default filter size -> 5 x 5 in 2D and 5 x 5 x 5 in 3D 

#### Grid_particle_4.py             -> Initial testing 2D code for solving particle-to-particle interaction
#### Grid_particle_4_filter.py      -> Create filter function using shifting operation (simultanesouly - high memory)
#### Grid_particle_4_filter_seq.py  -> Create filter function using shifting operation (sequentially   - low memory)
