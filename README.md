## AI4PDEs -> AI4DEM coupling with fluids

#### Default filter size -> 5 x 5 in 2D and 5 x 5 x 5 in 3D 

#### Grid_particle_4.py             -> Initial testing 2D code for solving particle-to-particle interaction
#### Grid_particle_4_filter.py      -> Create filter function using shifting operation (simultanesouly - high memory)
#### Grid_particle_4_filter_seq.py  -> Create filter function using shifting operation (sequentially   - low memory)

#### AI4DEM_speed.py      -> Initial AI4DEM code for testing the code (sequentially   - low memory) - do not consider boundary conditions 
#### AI4DEM_speed_seq.py  -> Initial AI4DEM code for testing the code (sequentially   - low memory) - do not consider boundary conditions
